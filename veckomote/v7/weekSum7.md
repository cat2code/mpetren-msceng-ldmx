#### Write end of week (Fridays) and present start of next week (Mondays): 

#### Format
* One win from this week (big or small)
* Something you need input on/help to get unstuck
* What you plan to focus on next week.

#### W7
* Wins
    * successfully got working wirh clusteranalyzer in ldmx-sw validation samples and produced some histograms (goal from last week)
    * I improved my workspace with my IDE and I have a nice set up for coding
    * found a bug in ldmx-sw with Lene-Kristian and i made my first git issue report and correspnding merge req referenced to the issue. 
        * I made a simple toy model for my project with a gnn set to a classification task on gaussian blobs in 2d space. 

* Help/Stuck
    * nothing definitive at the moment, issues that came up were resolved before end of last week
    * I might find issues in my focus-points this week and might need help from someone here or ”worst case” across the atlantic who implemented particlenet in ldmx-sw

* Focus
    * take inspiration of ways to extract ldmx-sw .root files output as input for a neural network architecure (presumably in python torch). Take inspiration from the particlenet implementation in ldmx-sw
    * produce a first example of using NN on .root data as input and attempt to design a very simple gnn model on that data
    * play around more with analyzers in it_pileup validation samples and further familiarization with the ldmx-sw framework
    * perhaps develop my toy example further and implement 3d space (though it might be unnecessary/wasted time).
