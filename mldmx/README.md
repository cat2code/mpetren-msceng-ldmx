# MLDMX

Machine-learning prototypes for LDMX event reconstruction, currently focused on
assigning ECal RecHits to incoming electrons using ECal information together
with TriggerPadTracks context. The newer pipelines are MLPF-inspired
transformer models that operate on variable-length event tokens.

## Current Focus

The active ECal/TriggerPad workflow reads ROOT events, builds per-event tensor
representations, trains hit-level prediction heads, and saves metrics,
checkpoints, and diagnostic plots.

Each context-aware event uses an 8-column node feature layout:

```text
[is_ecal, is_tpad, ecal_x, ecal_y, ecal_z, ecal_energy, tpad_centroid, tpad_pe]
```

ECal nodes receive supervised targets; TriggerPadTracks nodes provide context.
The default target mode is `canonical-y`, which orders electron targets by
their spatial position in each event instead of relying on arbitrary physical
origin IDs.

Maintained training entry points are:

- `scripts/train_hit_classifier_baseline.py`: common canonical-y runner for
  the four maintained hit-origin classification baselines.
- `scripts/train_ecal_tpad_slot_model.py`: balanced `2e`/`3e` training with
  hit-origin, energy-fraction, slot-validity, and event electron-count heads.
- `scripts/train_ecal_tpad_mlpf_lite_scaled.py`: scalable three-origin
  hit/fraction training on a configurable ROOT subset, with reusable tensor
  caches.

## Setup

Run commands from this `mldmx/` directory unless stated otherwise.

```powershell
cd mldmx
python -m pip install -e .
```

`pyproject.toml` currently installs the local package only; it does not declare
runtime dependencies. The working environment must already provide the
scientific/ML stack used by the scripts, including PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric,
uproot, awkward, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Quick Start

Run a forward/backward smoke test of the current slot model:

```powershell
python scripts/smoke_ecal_tpad_slot_model.py --max-events 3 --device cpu
```

The smoke test first looks for processed events in
`data/processed/ecal_tpad_3class_smoke/`; if they are unavailable it reads from
the `2e` and `3e` ROOT directories.

## Maintained Model Validation

Validate that all five maintained models consume the same canonical combined
event pipeline and canonical-y target convention:

```powershell
python scripts/validate_model_family_common_pipeline.py
```

The validation defaults to `data/processed/ecal_tpad_3class_smoke/`, runs only
CPU forward/backward checks, and writes no checkpoints or plots. It reports
whether the input preprocessing retained noise hits; the default smoke cache
filters noise, so it does not validate the slot model's noise/background task.
The two GravNet checks additionally require the PyTorch Geometric
`torch-cluster` runtime dependency in the active environment.

### Slot Noise Experiment

The normal slot workflow filters noise hits, so its background output class
receives no hit-level training examples by default. To run the advanced model
with explicit noise/background supervision from ROOT inputs:

```powershell
python scripts/train_ecal_tpad_slot_model.py `
  --supervise-noise `
  --events-per-class 100 `
  --epochs 20 `
  --device cpu `
  --run-name slot_noise_experiment
```

`--supervise-noise` is intentionally advanced-model-only and ROOT-backed:
existing processed caches do not contain aligned noise targets. Flagged noise
hits are assigned background class `0` and background-only fraction targets;
they do not enter canonical-y electron ordering or electron-count targets.
The slot trainer rejects the legacy `--keep-noise` option because it does not
supply background labels and can fail on flagged hits without contribution
truth; use `--supervise-noise` explicitly.

Run the focused CPU target/loss validation with:

```powershell
python scripts/smoke_ecal_tpad_slot_noise.py
```

### Baseline Training

Maintained origin-classification experiments for the four baseline models use
one common runner and the same canonical-y event pipeline:

```powershell
python scripts/train_hit_classifier_baseline.py `
  --model ECalTpadTransformer `
  --events-per-class 100 `
  --epochs 20 `
  --device cuda `
  --run-name tpad_transformer_100_per_class
```

Valid `--model` values are `ECalGravNet`, `ECalTpadGravNet`,
`ECalTransformer`, and `ECalTpadTransformer`. The runner trains only ECal
hit-origin cross-entropy and writes classification histories, checkpoints,
test confusion matrices, and representative ECal truth/prediction plots.
For the ten-event processed smoke cache, pass:

```powershell
python scripts/train_hit_classifier_baseline.py `
  --model ECalTransformer `
  --processed-dir data/processed/ecal_tpad_3class_smoke `
  --allow-small-split `
  --epochs 1 `
  --device cpu
```

This runner supersedes `scripts/simple_3_class_classification_*.py` for
maintained baseline experiments; those older scripts remain as prototype
references. GravNet models require the PyTorch Geometric `torch-cluster`
runtime dependency.

### Pipeline Benchmarking

Measure local IO, adapter, and representative forward/backward throughput
without writing run artifacts:

```powershell
python scripts/benchmark_common_pipeline.py `
  --processed-dir data/processed/ecal_tpad_3class_smoke `
  --root-dir data/ldmx_overlay_events_700k/3e/events `
  --max-events 5 `
  --device cpu
```

For smoke checks, use the processed smoke cache and small event limits. For
larger training jobs, prepare and reuse compatible processed canonical events
instead of repeatedly tensorizing ROOT input, and keep `--read-step-size`
available when ROOT preparation is required. Benchmark that chunk size on the
target filesystem; `50` is convenient for small local probes and the training
runners default to `500` for larger reads. When adapter overhead matters and
memory permits, pass `--cache-model-views` to the baseline trainer to derive
its selected model view once per loaded event and reuse it across epochs.
Without the optional `torch-cluster` dependency, the benchmark still reports
IO and transformer timings and marks GravNet model steps as skipped.

Train the balanced slot model on a small sample:

```powershell
python scripts/train_ecal_tpad_slot_model.py `
  --events-per-class 100 `
  --epochs 20 `
  --device cuda `
  --run-name slot_100_per_class
```

This script reads balanced samples from:

```text
data/ldmx_overlay_events_700k/2e/events/
data/ldmx_overlay_events_700k/3e/events/
```

It uses `data/processed/ecal_tpad_slot_model/` if processed tensor events have
already been created there. Results are written below
`outputs/ecal_tpad_slot_model/<run-name>/`.

Train the MLPF-lite transformer on a scalable `3e` subset:

```powershell
python scripts/train_ecal_tpad_mlpf_lite_scaled.py `
  --max-events 1000 `
  --epochs 20 `
  --device auto `
  --run-name mlpf_lite_1000
```

The scaled script reads `data/ldmx_overlay_events_700k/3e/events/` by default.
It automatically caches preprocessed events below
`data/processed/ecal_tpad_mlpf_lite_scaled/cache_<signature>/` and reuses the
cache when the ROOT inputs and preprocessing settings match. Add
`--force-preprocess` to rebuild a matching cache.

## Data Processing

For a single ROOT file, the preprocessing utility writes per-event `.pt`
tensors and a `manifest.json` file:

```powershell
python scripts/preprocess_ecal_tpad_dataset.py `
  --root-file path/to/events.root `
  --output-dir data/processed/my_dataset `
  --max-events 100
```

By default noise hits are filtered. Use `--keep-noise` to retain them and
`--no-edge-index` when only token tensors, rather than saved graph edges, are
needed.

### Scalable Sharded Cache

For large datasets, use ML-ready shards instead of the legacy
one-`.pt`-file-per-event format. Each source ROOT file becomes one processed
`.pt` shard, with `manifest.json` and `index.json` recording source files,
tensorization settings, event offsets, and shard contents:

```text
data/processed/ecal_tpad_2e3e_sharded/
  manifest.json
  index.json
  shards/
    shard_000001.pt
    shard_000002.pt
```

Create a mixed `2e`/`3e` cache explicitly:

```powershell
python scripts/preprocess_ecal_tpad_sharded.py `
  --source 2 2e data/ldmx_overlay_events_700k/2e/events `
  --source 3 3e data/ldmx_overlay_events_700k/3e/events `
  --output-dir data/processed/ecal_tpad_2e3e_sharded `
  --skip-existing
```

ROOT files are ordered by numeric suffix (`events_2.root` precedes
`events_10.root`). Rerunning reuses valid completed shards and fills missing
ones; pass `--force` to rebuild. The maintained trainers can also create a
missing matching cache and then reuse it:

```powershell
python scripts/train_hit_classifier_baseline.py `
  --model ECalTpadTransformer `
  --processed-cache data/processed/ecal_tpad_2e3e_sharded `
  --epochs 20 `
  --device cuda
```

With `--processed-cache`, training reads events lazily from shards, retains
only a small recent-shard cache in RAM, and uses shard-aware deterministic
iteration. It does not use `--events-per-class`; the cache represents its
selected ROOT files. `--max-events` can restrict the consumed events.
If cache creation was interrupted and a short trial should use only its
already completed valid shards, add `--allow-incomplete-sharded-cache`.
Without this explicit flag, a trainer resumes creation of the missing shards.

Quick smoke validation uses temporary shards and leaves no cache behind:

```powershell
python scripts/smoke_ecal_tpad_sharded_cache.py --device cpu --max-root-files 2 --max-events-per-root-file 2
```

The one-event-per-file processed format remains supported for existing small
datasets and prototype outputs.

For a minimal ROOT-to-tensor inspection path:

```powershell
python scripts/root_to_tensor_smoke.py path/to/events.root --stop 10
```

## Training Outputs

Training runs create timestamped directories unless `--run-name` is supplied.
Common artifacts include:

- `config.json`, `history.json`, `history.csv`, and `train.log`
- `checkpoints/latest.pt`, `checkpoints/best.pt`, and periodic checkpoints
- `final_metrics.json`, loss/accuracy histories, and confusion matrices
- ECal truth/prediction plots and fraction diagnostics
- For the slot model, event-count predictions and event-count confusion plots

Resume a compatible run with `--resume path/to/checkpoints/latest.pt`. The
dataset split, label configuration, and target mode must match the checkpoint.

Older `simple_3_class_classification_*.py` scripts remain useful as focused
prototypes for ECal-only, ECal/TriggerPad transformer, and graph baselines. The
slot-model and scaled MLPF-lite scripts contain the current end-to-end training
workflows.
